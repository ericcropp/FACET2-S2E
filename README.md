This repo uses Git LFS. Strongly recommend installing it: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage
Otherwise, manually download the requisite large files (namely .h5 beam files)

Start by setting up a Conda environment using bmadCondaEnv.yml (https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)

Try executing "2024-06-26 Testing quickstart utility.ipynb"; this should, using only a few lines, perform and plot an output from a Bmad simulation beginning from a pre-generated GPT beam file
