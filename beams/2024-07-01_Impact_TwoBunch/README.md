Using the Impact setup from https://github.com/ericcropp/Impact-T_Examples/blob/main/FACET-II_Impact_Bmad/Impact_Bmad.ipynb
Basically only change is updating the distgen.yaml t_dist to a superposition from Gaussian and tweaking L0A phase by -10 deg

Quick and dirty; don't expect this to be a long term reference beam.

Known problems
* Uses same VCC image for both arms
* L0A phase not checked; known that the L0AFEND LPS does not match GPT reference
